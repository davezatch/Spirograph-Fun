# Spirographs!

This is a little tool to make different Spirographs. It uses HTML5 Canvas for all the drawing, with some jQuery/jQuery UI for the controls.

# What's all this?

It loads with some preset parameters, and you can change any of them to see how it effects the spirograph.

Click the *draw it* button to see an animation of your spirograph being drawn.

If you like one, click the *Make it an image!* button to turn it into a .png file (with a transparent background). You can then right click and download it.

For fun, click *randomize everything!* to see a totally new shape.

Pull requests very welcome, and feel free to open an issue if you find any bugs.
